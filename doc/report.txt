Q: The FaceRecognizer::predict method returns a label indicating a match has been
   found. Is it possible to obtain a measure of the system's confidence in that
   match?
A: One overloaded version of the predict method has a return type of void and
   instead has two additional arguments taken by reference; one for the resulting
   label, and another for the confidence value, as a double, of the match. The
   current program recognizes the face if the face is detected across at least 10
   frames, allowing for some error. This algorithm could be improved by making
   use of the confidence value to increment the counter by a variable amount
   instead of by a constant amount for every detection regardless of confidence.

Q: Does the program compensate if you are far from the camera? Might a cascading
   classifier help?
A: In its current state, the program does not perform optimally when the face is
   significantly further away from, too close to, or at the wrong orientation to,
   the camera. Using a cascading classifier simply to detect the position and
   size of the face and eyes, the program could additionally perform affine
   transformations (translation, rotation, scaling, cropping) to align the face
   perfectly for prediction using the face recognition algorithm.
