Q: The FaceRecognizer::predict method returns a label indicating a match has been
   found. Is it possible to obtain a measure of the system's confidence in that
   match?
A: One overloaded version of the predict method has a return type of void and
   instead has two additional arguments taken by reference; one for the resulting
   label, and another for the confidence value, as a double, of the match.
